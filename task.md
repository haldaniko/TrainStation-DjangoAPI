Take this task seriously, because this project will be attached to your CV as the 2nd project.

Task:
1. Choose 1 and only 1 project from the options, given to you in the Theory tab of this topic. Be sure, that the option is interesting for you.
2. Create your own public repo on your GitHub account. Name it corresponding to your selected project. Important switch to the develop branch for implementing the project functionality. You will have to create a PR from the develop to the main branch and attach it as a solution to this task.
3. Implement the project, using the Cinema Shop project as an example, of what should be done. Important Make sure to name your commits properly - we will check the namings of your commits. And after each change to your project (creating a new endpoint, implementing new models, etc..) - please, make a commit with the proper name.
4. Think about adding some additional custom logic for your project.
5. Write the instructions in README.md on how to run your API locally, for example: Installing using GitHub Run with docker
6. Create Pull Request from the develop branch to the main branch of your own repo.
7. Write your API’s features: Features Hint: don’t forget to add detailed instructions on getting access to your project so visitors can also use the functionality.
8. Attach screenshots of different pages of your Browsable API. If you've added new functionality or implemented something optional - write a short description in the PR, of what you've done. If you've added new models or changed DB-structure - it is obligatory to add the DB-structure diagram (create it using draw.io).
9. Attach the link to this PR as a solution.
